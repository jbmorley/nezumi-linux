# Nezumi (Linux)

Linux version of the [Nezumi](https://github.com/jbmorley/nezumi) project.

This is a somewhat experimental port of the core animation and interaction loop of Nezumi to Linux via Raylib. It's intended for use on embedded devices as an interactive picture frame.

This will probably be rolled into the main Nezumi repository in the future.

# Development

```shell
make
./main
```
